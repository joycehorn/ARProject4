# AR-Rehab: Augmented Reality Assisted Rehabilitation Therapy with Leap Motion and Vuforia

## Overview:
AR-Rehab is an augmented reality application designed to assist individuals undergoing rehabilitation therapy by providing real-time feedback and guidance on their movements and techniques. Using the Leap Motion controller for precise hand tracking and Vuforia interaction with virtual objects placed in the physical environment, AR-Rehab analyzes the user's hand movements during therapy exercises, offering visual and auditory feedback to ensure proper form and technique.

## AR Technology and APIs:
AR-Rehab will be developed using Unity3D as the AR development platform and will integrate the Leap Motion SDK for hand tracking capabilities. Additionally, the application will leverage Vuforia for marker-based tracking and object recognition functionalities. Vuforia's features will enable the anchoring of virtual objects to specific physical markers or objects in the environment, enhancing the interactive and immersive nature of the rehabilitation therapy exercises.

## Target Audience:
AR-Rehab is designed for individuals undergoing rehabilitation therapy for injuries, surgeries, or medical conditions affecting mobility or motor function. This includes patients recovering from stroke, orthopedic injuries, neurological disorders, and musculoskeletal conditions.

## Milestones:
1. Implement hand tracking functionality using the Leap Motion controller.
2. Develop motion analysis algorithms to analyze and interpret user movements during therapy exercises.
3. Design and implement a user-friendly interface for the AR application, including exercise selection and feedback visualization.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness and usability of AR-Rehab.

## Deliverables:
The final deliverables for AR-Rehab will include:
- A video demonstration showcasing the application's features and functionality.
- A detailed write-up documenting the development process, technical implementation, testing results.
- The source code of the AR-Rehab application hosted here on GitHub for further exploration and development.

## Additional Notes:
- Collaboration with healthcare professionals will be sought to ensure that AR-Rehab meets the needs and requirements of clinical settings.
